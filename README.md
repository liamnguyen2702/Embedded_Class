BITWISE OPERATORS

  1, The & (bitwise AND) - The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. (time)

  2, The | (bitwise OR) - The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.

  3, The ^ (bitwise XOR) - The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

  4, The ~ (bitwise NOT) - Takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

  5, The << (left shift) - Takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. (delete the left)

  6, The >> (right shift) - Takes tow numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. (delete the right)
